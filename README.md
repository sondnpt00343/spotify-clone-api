## üéØ API Testing

### Using Postman Collection
1. Import `Spotify_Clone_API.postman_collection.json` into Postman
2. Set the `BASE_URL` variable to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Use the Login endpoint to obtain an access token
4. The token will be automatically set for authenticated requests
5. Test all endpoints with realistic data and scenarios

### Manual Testing
All endpoints support standard HTTP methods and return JSON responses with consistent error handling and status codes.
